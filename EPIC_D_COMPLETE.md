## Technical Implementation

### Animation Strategy
1. **Framer Motion** for component animations:
   - Page transitions (fade-in, slide-up)
   - Metric card staggered entrance
   - Timeframe selector indicator
   - AI panel content reveal

2. **Custom count-up animation:**
   - Uses `useMotionValue` and `animate` from Framer Motion
   - Formats numbers as currency, percentage, or plain numbers
   - 1.5s duration with ease-out easing

3. **Typed text effect:**
   - Character-by-character reveal
   - Blinking cursor indicator
   - Configurable speed (default 20ms)

### Color System
- **Profit/Gain:** `#16a34a` (green-600)
- **Loss:** `#dc2626` (red-600)
- **Background:** `#111827` (gray-900)
- **Cards:** `#1f2937` (gray-800)
- **Borders:** `#374151` (gray-700)

### Chart Segmentation Logic
The P&L chart automatically splits the data into color-coded segments:
1. Iterate through all data points
2. Detect zero crossings (sign changes)
3. Create separate traces for each segment
4. Apply appropriate color (green/red)
5. Ensure continuity by including previous point in new segment

## API Integration

### Endpoints Used
1. **`POST /api/ingest`** - Upload CSV with template_id
2. **`GET /api/metrics?timeframe={tf}&job_id={id}`** - Fetch metrics
3. **`GET /api/chart?timeframe={tf}&job_id={id}`** - Fetch chart data
4. **`GET /api/benchmarks/{symbol}?timeframe={tf}`** - Fetch benchmark data
5. **`GET /api/ai/coach?timeframe={tf}&job_id={id}`** - Fetch AI insights
6. **`GET /api/demo/*`** - Demo mode endpoints

### Data Flow
```
Landing Page
    ↓ (Upload CSV)
POST /api/ingest
    ↓ (Returns job_id)
Navigate to /dashboard?job_id={id}
    ↓
Dashboard Page
    ├→ GET /api/metrics (MetricsHeader)
    ├→ GET /api/chart (PLChart)
    ├→ GET /api/benchmarks/* (PLChart - optional)
    └→ GET /api/ai/coach (AICoachPanel)
```

## Testing Checklist

### Build Tests ✅
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes
- [x] Vite build completes successfully
- [x] No critical linting errors
- [x] Bundle size: ~5MB (includes Plotly.js)

### Visual Tests (To Be Verified)
- [ ] Landing page renders correctly
- [ ] CSV upload form works

## Known Issues & Considerations

### Bundle Size Warning
- Plotly.js adds ~5MB to bundle (gzipped: ~1.5MB)
- Consider code-splitting or lazy loading if performance becomes an issue
- Alternative: Switch to lighter chart library (Recharts, Chart.js)

### Type Declarations
- Created custom type declaration for react-plotly.js
- May need updates if Plotly API changes

### Animation Performance
- Tested locally; Railway deployment performance TBD
- Monitor frame rates in production
- May need to reduce animation complexity for lower-end devices

## Next Steps (Epic E - AI Coach Backend)

1. **Implement `/api/ai/coach` endpoint**
   - OpenAI JSON mode integration
   - Schema validation
   - Retry logic with fallback

2. **Create AI insights service**
   - Aggregate metrics collection
   - Prompt engineering for patterns/risks
   - Response validation

3. **Add contract tests**
   - Validate JSON schema
   - Test retry/fallback logic
   - Verify no ticker recommendations

4. **Benchmark data endpoints**
   - Implement `/api/benchmarks/{symbol}`
   - Store or fetch SPY/DIA/QQQ data
   - Calculate cumulative returns
