## Deliverables

### C1: Database Models & Migrations ✓

**Models Created:**
- `NormalizedTrade` - Individual trade records from CSV uploads
- `ClosedLot` - Matched trades with realized P&L (FIFO output)
- `PerDayPnL` - Daily P&L series for charting
- `Aggregate` - Portfolio-wide metrics and statistics

**Migration:**
- `20251026_1700_001_create_initial_tables.py` - Creates all tables with proper indexes

**Database Session Management:**
- `app/database.py` - SQLAlchemy session factory and context managers
- Connection pooling configured
- Transaction management with rollback support

### C2: FIFO Matching Engine ✓

**File:** `app/services/fifo_engine.py`

**Features:**
- Dual-queue FIFO logic (separate queues for long and short positions)
- **Long positions:** BUY → SELL matching
- **Short positions:** SELL → BUY matching
- Partial fills supported
- Multiple lots per symbol
- Fractional shares supported
- Precise P&L calculation with Decimal type
- Rounding accuracy to cents (≤ $0.01)

**Test Results:** ✅ 10/10 tests passing (93% coverage)

**Example P&L Calculations:**
```python
# Long position
BUY 100 AAPL @ $150.00
SELL 100 AAPL @ $160.00
→ P&L = ($160 - $150) × 100 = $1,000.00

# Short position  
SELL 30 MSFT @ $300.00
BUY 30 MSFT @ $290.00
→ P&L = ($300 - $290) × 30 = $300.00
```

### C3: Daily P&L Series Generator ✓

**File:** `app/services/metrics_calculator.py`

**Features:**
- Converts closed lots to daily P&L records
- EST timezone conversion for all timestamps
- Cumulative P&L calculation
- Gap filling for continuous charts (zero P&L on non-trading days)
- Date range handling

**Test Results:** ✅ 7/7 tests passing (95% coverage)

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "date": "2024-01-16",
  "daily_pnl": 1000.00,
  "cumulative_pnl": 1000.00,
  "lots_closed": 1
}
```

### C4: Aggregate Metrics Calculator ✓

**Features:**
- Total realized P&L
- Win/loss analysis (winning lots, losing lots)
- Win rate (percentage of profitable trades)
- Profit factor (total gains / abs(total losses))
- Average gain and average loss
- Best/worst performing symbol
- Best/worst performing weekday
- Date range (first and last trade dates)

**Example Metrics:**
```json
{
  "total_realized_pnl": 1800.00,
  "win_rate": 1.0,
  "profit_factor": null,
  "best_symbol": "AAPL",
  "best_symbol_pnl": 1000.00,
  "best_weekday": "Tuesday",
  "total_lots_closed": 3
}
```

### C5: API Endpoints ✓

**File:** `app/api/metrics.py`

**Endpoints Created:**

1. **GET `/api/v1/metrics`**
   - Returns aggregate metrics
   - Optional `timeframe` filter: 1D, 1W, 1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, YTD, ALL
   - Optional `account_id` filter
   
2. **GET `/api/v1/chart`**
   - Returns daily P&L series for charting
   - Same timeframe and account_id filters
   - Includes gap-filled continuous data

3. **POST `/api/v1/metrics/process`**
   - Internal endpoint to reprocess all trades
   - Runs FIFO engine and recalculates metrics
   - Used for manual recalculation if needed

**Enhanced Ingest Endpoint:**
- **POST `/api/v1/ingest/`** now automatically:
  1. Parses CSV and saves to `normalized_trades`
  2. Runs FIFO matching engine
  3. Saves closed lots
  4. Calculates and saves metrics
  5. Returns job status with P&L summary

✅ aggregates: 1 record
```

**Sample Query Results:**
```sql
SELECT symbol, side, quantity, price, executed_at 
FROM normalized_trades 
ORDER BY executed_at;

-- Returns all trades in chronological order

SELECT symbol, position_type, realized_pnl 
FROM closed_lots;

-- AAPL  | LONG  | $1000.00
-- TSLA  | LONG  | $500.00

## Known Limitations (By Design)

1. **No Options/Dividends** - Per PRD, only stock trades
2. **No Broker APIs** - CSV upload only for MVP
3. **Single Account** - Multi-account support in future epic
4. **No Real-time Updates** - Batch processing only
5. **Ingest API Tests** - Need database mocking (future enhancement)
