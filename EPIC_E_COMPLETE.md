# Epic E: AI Coach - Complete âœ…

**Completion Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Status:** Fully implemented and tested against PRD requirements

---

## Overview

Epic E delivers the AI Coach feature using OpenAI's JSON mode to provide deterministic insights about trading patterns and risks, with NO ticker recommendations per PRD requirements.

---

## PRD Requirements Validation

### **PRD Section 7: AI Insights (OpenAI JSON Mode)**

Let's validate each requirement from the PRD:

#### âœ… Requirement 1: Input - Aggregated metrics + symbol summaries

**PRD States:**
> Input: Aggregated metrics + symbol summaries.

**Implementation:**
```python
# From ai_coach.py (lines 54-66)
metrics = {
    "cumulative_pnl": float(aggregate.total_realized_pnl),
    "total_trades": aggregate.total_trades,
    "win_rate": float(aggregate.win_rate),
    "profit_factor": float(aggregate.profit_factor),
    "avg_gain": float(aggregate.average_gain),
    "avg_loss": float(aggregate.average_loss),
    "best_symbol": aggregate.best_symbol,
    "worst_symbol": aggregate.worst_symbol,
    "best_weekday": aggregate.best_weekday,
    "worst_weekday": aggregate.worst_weekday,
}
```

**Validation:** âœ… PASS
- Collects all aggregate metrics from database
- Passes to AI service for analysis
- Symbol summaries included (best/worst symbols)

---

#### âœ… Requirement 2: Schema - Exact JSON structure

**PRD States:**
```json
{
  "summary": "string",
  "pattern_insights": [{"title": "...","evidence_metric": "...","why_it_matters": "..."}],
  "risk_notes": [{"title": "...","trigger_condition": "...","mitigation_tip": "..."}],
  "top_actions": [{"priority":1,"action":"..."}]
}
```

**Implementation:**
- **Schema File:** `/specs/json_contracts/ai_coach.json`
- **Pydantic Models:** `AICoachResponse`, `PatternInsight`, `RiskNote`, `TopAction`

**Test Output:**
```
âœ… Has 'summary' field
âœ… Has 'pattern_insights' field
âœ… Has 'risk_notes' field
âœ… Has 'top_actions' field
âœ… Pattern insights have correct structure
âœ… Risk notes have correct structure
âœ… Top actions have correct structure
```

**Validation:** âœ… PASS
- Exact schema match with PRD specification
- Validated via Pydantic models
- JSON serialization tested and working

---

#### âœ… Requirement 3: Constraints - No ticker advice/recommendations

**PRD States:**
> Constraints: No ticker advice / recommendations.

**Implementation:**
```python
# From ai_coach_service.py (lines 151-158)
"You are a trading performance analyst. Analyze trading metrics and provide "
"educational insights about patterns and risks. NEVER provide specific ticker "
"recommendations or trade calls. Focus on behavioral patterns, risk management, "
"and general trading discipline observations."
```

**Test Output:**
```
âœ… No explicit ticker recommendations detected
```

**Validation:** âœ… PASS
- System prompt explicitly forbids ticker recommendations
- Fallback responses contain no ticker advice
- Test validates no forbidden phrases (buy, sell, short, long)

---

#### âœ… Requirement 4: Display - Typed-out animation in UI

**PRD States:**
> Display: Typed-out animation in UI with fade-in per bullet.

**Implementation:**
- **Component:** `AICoachPanel.tsx`
- **Animation:** `TypedText.tsx` (character-by-character typing)
- **Fade Effects:** Framer Motion staggered animations

**Code:**
```tsx
// TypedText component with typing animation
<TypedText
  text={insights.summary}
  speed={20}
  className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed"
/>

// Staggered fade-in for insights
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, x: -20 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, x: 0 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.4, delay: idx * 0.1 }}
>
```

**Validation:** âœ… PASS
- Typing animation implemented (20ms per character)
- Fade-in animations for each insight card
- Staggered delays (0.1s between items)

---

#### âœ… Requirement 5: Retry - On invalid JSON, retry once then fallback

**PRD States:**
> Retry: On invalid JSON, retry once then show neutral fallback.

**Implementation:**
```python
# From ai_coach_service.py (lines 68-97)
self.max_retries = 1  # Per PRD: retry once on failure

for attempt in range(self.max_retries + 1):
    try:
        response = self._call_openai(metrics, symbol_summary)
        validated_response = AICoachResponse(**response)
        return validated_response
    except ValidationError as e:
        logger.error(f"Schema validation failed on attempt {attempt + 1}")
        if attempt < self.max_retries:
            logger.info("Retrying OpenAI call...")
            continue
        else:
            logger.warning("Max retries reached - returning fallback")
            return self._get_fallback_response(metrics)
```

**Validation:** âœ… PASS
- Retry logic: 1 retry attempt (total 2 calls max)
- Fallback response on failure
- Structured logging for debugging
